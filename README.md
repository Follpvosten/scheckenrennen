# Scheckenrennen

This project was initially created for the 4th year PGTL class at the LBS Eibiswald. However, 
the software has become very umfangreich, so i decided to upload it to GitHub for the greater 
good.

The project is made with NetBeans in the Java programming language, and is uploaded as a 
NetBeans project. Good luck in finding out how to use that.

This project may be turned into a giant tool for actually supervising snail races if i have too 
much time and feel like it. Nothing's guaranteed, tho.
