# Scheckenrennen

This project was initially created for the 4th year PGTL class at the LBS Eibiswald. However, 
the software has become very umfangreich, so i decided to upload it to GitHub for the greater 
good.

The project is made with NetBeans in the Java programming language, and is uploaded as a 
NetBeans project. Good luck in finding out how to use that.

It may be turned into a tool for *actually* supervising snail races if i have too much
time and feel like it. Nothing's guaranteed, tho.

## Compiling and running the project

First, clone then project. Then, do  
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
to get the org.json package working.

Finally, you will most likely need NetBeans, which should be able to just open the project and 
run it by using the Run button.  
That's it.
